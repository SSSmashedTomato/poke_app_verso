# Guide To Run pokedex App


## Prerequisites


This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.	Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:


A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:	- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev): Make sure you have the Flutter SDK installed. You can download it from the official Flutter website.


- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)	- Dart SDK: Flutter uses the Dart programming language, so you'll need the Dart SDK as well. The Flutter SDK includes the Dart SDK, so if you've installed Flutter, you should already have it.
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)	


For help getting started with Flutter development, view the	- Integrated Development Environment (IDE): You can use any text editor or IDE of your choice, but for a better development experience, it is recommended to use either **Visual Studio Code** or **Android Studio**. Make sure you have your preferred IDE installed and set up for Flutter development.
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,	
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.	## Execution Steps

Once you have the prerequisites in place, follow these steps to execute your Flutter project:

1. **Clone the project:** If you haven't done so already, clone the Flutter project repository to your local machine using a Git client or by downloading the project as a ZIP file.

2. **Open the project:** Open your preferred IDE (Visual Studio Code or Android Studio) and select the "Open Folder" option. Navigate to the project's root directory and open it.

3. **Install dependencies:** In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project's root directory and run the following command to fetch the project dependencies:

   ```
   flutter pub get
   ```

   This command will download and install all the necessary packages and dependencies required for your Flutter project.

4. **Connect a device:** Connect a physical device (Android or iOS) to your computer using a USB cable or set up an emulator/simulator for the desired platform. Ensure that your device or emulator is properly configured and recognized by your operating system.

5. **Verify device connection:** To verify that your Flutter project recognizes the connected device, run the following command:

   ```
   flutter devices
   ```

   This command will display a list of connected devices or emulators. Make sure your target device is listed and correctly identified.

6. **Run the project:** In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project's root directory and execute the following command:

   ```
   flutter run
   ```

   This command will build the Flutter project and launch it on the connected device or emulator. It may take some time during the first run as Flutter compiles the code and sets up the necessary environment.

7. **Interact with the app:** Once the build process is complete, you should see your Flutter app running on the connected device or emulator. You can now interact with the app and test its functionality.

## Additional Considerations

- **Platform-specific execution:** Depending on the Flutter project and its configuration, you may need to specify the target platform explicitly. For example, you can run the app on an Android device by using the command `flutter run -d <device_id>` and replace `<device_id>` with the ID of the connected device or emulator. Similarly, you can specify iOS as the target platform by using `flutter run -d <device_id>` for iOS devices.

- **Hot reload and hot restart:** Flutter provides a powerful feature called hot reload, which allows you to see the changes you make in your code instantly without restarting the app. Pressing **r** or **R** in the terminal while the app is running triggers hot reload. Similarly, pressing **Shift+r** or **Shift+R** triggers a hot restart, which
